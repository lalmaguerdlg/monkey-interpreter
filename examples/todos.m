# TODO: 
# This file a list of features I would like to implement in the language:

# Hashmaps

let person = {
  # string keys 
  age: 18,
  name: "Mike",
  "friend-group": [],
  # nested maps
  likes: {
    food: {
      # boolean keys 
      true: "Mike like's food",
      false: "Mike doesnt like food"
    }
  }
  # number keys
  ids: {
    10: "",
    15: ""
  }
}


# dot (.) operator
person.age
person.name

# loops !
while <condition> {
 <block>
}

# for each
for <ident> in <expression> {
  <block>
}

# range() == iterators ??
for i in range(len(testSum)) {

}
